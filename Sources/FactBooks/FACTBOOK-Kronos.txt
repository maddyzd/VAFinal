FACTBOOK :: Kronos 
Introduction
Background:
Kronos was variously settled by the peoples of the Levant as far back as the Phoenicians, but avoided attempts at colonization by the British and French. The island's economy has been dominated by three main industries. Agriculture has long dominated the local economy with most Kronisians supporting themselves through small-scale farming. Recently the timber industry has taken off; however, deforestation is a real threat. With the discovery of massive natural gas fields in 1994, the Kronisian economy has been booming. Despite the recent economic boom, many people still face deep poverty.
