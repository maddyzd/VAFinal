POK members held their annual demonstration in Abila yesterday.  A larger than usual crowd gathered in front of the Capitol building, waving signs holding pictures of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann, who were painted as POK "martyrs".  The crowds chanted about government corruption and called for President Dorel Kapelou to step down.  Several protestors carried signs calling for an end to the "exploitive Tethys corporate capitalism" and alleging, "GAStech poisoned our kids".  

Police and government security forces set up between the protestors and the Capitol building in a show of force, hoping to prevent the kind of chaos that occurred during last year's riot.  However, after several hours of chanting and speeches, tempers in the crowd flared and protestors rushed the police line.  The police forces were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets to subdue the crowd and protect property.  In spite of their heroic efforts, the protestors managed to break some windows, damage several police vehicles, and injure three officers.

Dozens of protesters attending a Protectors of Kronos (POK) rally in front of the GAStech regional headquarters in Abila were arrested for trespassing this morning.  The POK rally was intended to draw attention to their claims of environmental damage being caused by the development of gas and oil fields around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, "We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."

The POK, once a small political activist group of citizens from the Elodis area, has been revitalization under the charismatic leadership of Elian Karel.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of today's POK rally, "We have been concerned by a pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos for some time now. In light of today's incident, President Kapelou has ordered the police to provide additional protection for the public at future POK rallys."

A motion to increase taxes on oil and gas development by an additional 10% was defeated today in the General Assembly by a vote of 77 to 23.  The proposed tax increase, championed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola, was to provide specific funding for health care, clean water projects, and health education for rural areas.  Minister Nespola said of the Assembly vote, "I'm disappointed by the vote, but the Assembly was concerned that the increase in tax would discourage foreign investment in our energy sector.  This is a setback to my program to help our rural townships, but I am nothing if not persistent.  My office will be sending a revised added tax measure to the Assembly later this year.  Additionally, I will work with President Kapelou's office to restructure the allocation of funds from current gas and oil taxes to provide for rural health projects."

Five young people were arrested yesterday for protesting near the entrance to the Tiskele Bend fields as they called for government action to address their environmental concerns about GAStech's operations at the site.  The protestors, members of the activist group "Protectors of Kronos", held signs reading: "Drilling Poisoned Our Water" and "Remember Juliana", referring to 10 year old Juliana Vann, who has become an icon for the Protectors of Kronos since her death in 1998.  The protestors were arrested after one young man threw his sign at a government vehicle, cracking its window and startling the occupants.  Police spokesman Adrien Carman said of the arrests, "We decided to shut the protest down before the POK members escalated to further violence.  They were getting pretty animated out there."

"These 'Protectors of Kronos' are really a fringe minority of people against the extraction of fossils fuels in our country," said Government spokesman Carmine Gurganus.  "The people of Kronos have overwhelmingly been for the development of our natural resources and all have benefited from the resultant economic growth.  These activists clearly don't understand the whole picture."

Protestors handed out flyers to bystanders that alleged that our government is corrupt and "the rich get richer on the backs of the poor".

The violence escalated into a full blown riot and police were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and beanbags shot from shotguns to control the crowd.  

By the time the crowds finally dispersed, several government buildings had been vandalized, two police vehicles were ablaze, and the streets were littered with trash and broken glass.  Several protestors and police were injured, including one heroic police officer who was stabbed by a crazed protestor.  The officer, whose name has been withheld for security reasons, is in critical condition at Abila General Hospital.

Today is the fifth anniversary of President Araullo's visionary plan to bring foreign investment to Kronos, a bold act that has reaped tremendous benefits for our fair country.  Today's Abila is a bustling metropolis full of new cars, new construction, gleaming office buildings, and modern conveniences.  Gone are the potholed streets, run-down factories, tired storefronts, and sad marketplaces of the past.  Today's Abila is a city of industry, a place of commerce and investment, a place of opportunity and success.  Prosperity has come to Kronos, and we are all the better for it.

However, there are still those who wrongly think that prosperity is bad for us.  These people claim that foreign investment is bad for our country, that it is diluting our culture and undermining our values.  They claim that the foreigners are exploiting us for their own gain and that our government has little regard for the welfare of our people.  They are so militant in their wrong-headed beliefs that they have fabricated claims that the foreign companies are poisoning our children with their technology.  They have even gone so far as to have brought in foreign "experts" who claim to "have our best interests at heart" to help spread their agenda against progress and prosperity for our people.  The hypocrisy of bringing in foreigners to tell us that opening our country to foreigners is bad for us is ludicrous and is obviously a sign of mental illness in those who oppose our modernization.

Hospital Administrator Torsten Trucco lauded the government's action saying, "We've been trying to get funding to update our facilities for years, to no avail.  We have been living on borrowed time for quite a while now with the old boiler.  It's been pure luck that the old girl hasn't failed on us completely."

The new Abila General will have 350 beds, a substantial upgrade from the mere 100 beds of the current antiquated facility.  Additionally, it will have a full emergency services area, trauma and burn care units, a psychiatric care wing, and four ultra-modern surgical suites.  In his announcement of the new construction, Araullo said, "Our strategy of courting foreign investment is paying great dividends.  This new hospital is the first of many projects we plan to pursue to help upgrade our standard of living and modernize our lifestyle."

TITLE: Government Announces Tax Incentives For Foreign Investment

Today the Parliament voted 86 to 14 in favor of President Araullo's package of tax incentives designed to lure foreign investment to our fair country. Tomas Sarto, Minister of the Interior, lauded the vote as "a landmark deal designed to better the lives of all Kronosians".  

The tax incentives specifically target energy development companies, which the government hopes to lure to Kronos' rich, but yet undeveloped, gas fields.  Ministry of the Interior projections show that development of just the Tiskele Bend fields could bring in as many as 5,000 high paying jobs and yield billions of dollars of infrastructure development over the next 20 years.

President Araullo today announced the signing of an agreement between his government and the Tethys-based GAStech International for the development of the Tiskele Bend gas fields.  GAStech, under the leadership of visionary Sten Sanjorge Jr., was awarded exclusive rights to drill in the government-owned fields after agreeing to the government's request that 50% or more of the workforce be Kronosian citizens.  President Araullo hailed the landmark deal as "the beginning of a new era for our great country, an era of opportunity and fortune for all."  Our sources at the Ministry of Interior tell us that the 50% tax levied on new oil and gas exploration could yield in excess of $1 billion in tax revenue per year.  This will allow the government to make unprecedented investments into infrastructure, health care, and education.

The Abila police held a press conference at nine this morning on the kidnapping GAStech headquarters.  Police informed reporters that four of the GAStech employees whose whereabouts were unconfirmed yesterday were found overnight, leaving ten people who are presumed missing.

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said Tethyn federal law enforcement agencies are assisting in the investigation.

The POK is suspected of conducting the kidnapping, but they have yet to claim credit or release a ransom request.  The POK rhetoric has become increasingly anarchist and their actions more criminal and violent over the past several years.

More than a dozen POK protesters were handcuffed and taken into custody by police Tuesday for blocking access to the Tiskele Bend fields.  Before police made the arrests shortly after 9 a.m., the protesters were told they were breaking the law for trespassing on government property, blocking access to government-owned land, and impeding lawful commercial traffic. 

The protesters arrived at the entrance to the Tiskele Bend site about 5:30 a.m. and locked arms across the road for about three hours, despite being asked to leave by police.  As traffic on the road began to back up, several truck drivers began to leave their vehicles and congregate near the protesters.  Tempers began to flare as the blockade persisted into the second hour, and the drivers started shouting and cursing at the protesters to move out of the road.  Police officers quickly moved in and arrested the POK protesters before the situation could escalate to violence.  

"We appreciate citizens voicing their opinion, but the middle of a busy road is not the right forum for a discussion of our national environmental policy. We encourage our concerned citizens to follow the democratic process and contact their Assembly representatives," government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said in a statement.

Kronos police arrested Elian Karel today on charges of tax evasion.  Karel, the leader of the activist group "Protectors of Kronos", was conducting a meeting with his supporters when he was arrested.  Karel tried to make light of the situation, but his followers were clearly concerned about the seriousness of the charges leveled against him.  Karel's lawyer, Michale Kraft, released a statement declaring that the charges against his client were false and that he hoped to have Karel released from police custody by week's end.  In response to Kraft's statement, Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, "I think Mr. Kraft has underestimated the seriousness of his client's situation."  It is clear that Elian Karel, who professes to have the interests of the people of Kronos at heart, must explain to us why he refuses to contribute to the welfare of his nation.
