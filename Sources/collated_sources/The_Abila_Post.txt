LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

Protests erupted around the Kronos government buildings, downtown, and elsewhere around Abila eventually escalating into riots and violence. 

The activists are protesting the death yesterday of Elian Karel, a Protector of Kronos (POK) activist who died in jail after being arrested for tax evasion. However, the protests have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops.

Countless shop windows smashed in and around Siopa, the downtown shopping area. A general sense of chaos broke out with chanting protesters, fires, and fleeing citizens. 

A unifying theme of the protesters was the chanted slogans including "Justice for Elian" in reference to previously mentioned activist Elian Karel and "Remember Juliana", a young girl from Elodis who died in 1998 allegedly from the effects of water contamination. Several buildings were defaced with the above mentioned slogans as well.

The Kronos government issued a statement, "This sort of violence will not be condoned. Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other. The Protectors of Kronos must resume peaceful means; all other approaches are unjustifiable."

Letters purported to be from the Protectors of Kronos (POK) have been received by Vincent Kapelou, Minister of Health and nephew of President Kapelou. The threatening letters appear to be the empty threats of an attention-seeking organization and nothing more.

Mr. Kapelou said, "Chances are this is nothing, but we're not going to take any chances." Nonetheless he has doubled the size of his personal security force in response to the letters.

These sorts of threats only reinforce the fact that the POK are a "public threat" to quote President Kapelou.

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues. However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert. 

The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed. Indeed, "pointing a finger of blame at this time would be hasty and most likely detrimental to the investigation."

Though the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, "The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract."

The Government of Kronos continues to offer well testing for concerned residents of Elodis as well as plans to further investigate the root causes of the illnesses in and around the township.

A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan.

There is still speculation regarding who was taken in the kidnapping and whether GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target, given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago.

At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.

January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting with a Kronos Government reception to follow. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office.

The Protectors of Kronos (POK) continue to protest against the Kronos Government and GAStech International alleging pollution, water contamination and a lack of a government response. Lately the protests have turned violent escalating into rioting largely directed at the Tiskele Bend site.

The latest event involved POK protesters forming a human chain to block the entrance of GAStech's Tiskele Bend site. After the recent rioting, government officials had no choice, but to round up the protesters and arrest them for trespassing.

Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau commented, "These sort of violent actions by members of the Protectors of Kronos are counterproductive. We are working closely - the government and GAStech - to ensure that all environmental issues are resolved."

Several instances of rioting in and around Elodis have been reported including the trashing of government buildings, rock throwing, and tire burnings. Police have responded swiftly and decisively. The various skirmishes with police have ended in arrests.

Protesters aligned with the Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist group surrounded government buildings chanting and carry images of their so-called martyrs. Kronos government security forces in concert with Abila police suppressed the protest with an impressive show of force.

Dressed in black the authorities donning helmets and gasmasks and brandishing riot shields, fired tear gas canisters as the protesters refused to disperse after several warnings. The group gathered proved reluctant to disperse even after the tear gas and the authorities pressed into the group protecting themselves with their shields and freely swinging their batons.

In the face of overwhelming force, most of the protesters fled; however, a hard core group stood their ground suffering the consequences. The remaining protesters were surrounded by the riot police and after repeated baton blows many were dragged away under arrest. 

When the smoke cleared amongst the discarded and trampled banners and signs, blood was clearly visible on the plaza.

For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member.

Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, "I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I know no one from Elodis. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life. Just because a person has the same name as a criminal does not make him a criminal."

Though he was instructed not to communicate with the press Vann was adamant to stress his innocence. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the police or the government for not leaving any stone unturned.

TITLE: WHO ARE THE PROTESTERS 

PUBLISHED: 22 August 2012 

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting? 

The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. 

In 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. 

Also in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since. 

The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel's death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence. 

The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a "public threat".

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

An alarming new trend is sweeping Abila. Police point out a dramatic increase in drug related arrests that may be linked to violent activist groups. 

The port of Abila is known to be a transshipment point for drugs coming from the Middle East and Africa going to Europe namely heroin and hashish. However, drug related arrests had remained flat over the past decade until the recent increase. 

The concerns over the increase of drug related arrests are two-fold: first, violent activist groups such as the Protectors of Kronos could be using drug sales as a means to fund their activities; and second, with more drugs appearing on the shore, the people of Kronos will suffer increased drug related issues, namely addiction and violence.

The international healthy water awareness group Wellness for All (WFA) have performed testing on the local water in Elodis finding high level of hazardous materials in residential water wells. 

In a statement released by WFA, the group directs blame to the Government of Kronos and GAStech International, a natural gas company from Tethys. In addition to directing blame WFA also demands that the two clean up the contamination, which includes high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium.

By bringing attention to the contamination in and around Elodis, WFA expects the international community will pressure the Government of Kronos into action. Additionally, WFA has been working with the activist group Protectors of Kronos to lobby the government to apply pressure.

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

A spark at the GAStech International-owned well at the Tiskele Bend site ignited methane gas several hundred feet underground, causing a fireball and fire that burned for about an hour is the findings from a dual GAStech - government investigation of the explosion and subsequent fire Sunday morning. 

Four GAStech employees suffered injuries including minor burns and broken bones. In contrast to previous reports there were no deaths and none missing as a result of the incident. No local residents were injured as well and though some residents of Elodis were evacuated from their homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary. 

While the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself. GAStech's wellheads are ringed with collars that have set pins running through them. One of the pins may have blown out of the collar, releasing the gas, which then came in contact with a spark.

As The World reported on 16 December 2013, GAStech International's recent initial public offering (IPO) netted Sten Sanjorge, Jr. an eye-popping $1.96 billion for his controlling share of the international gas drilling and exploration company. 

The GAStech - Kronos leadership was also handsomely rewarded. The IPO filings show that the executive group earned a collective $327.25 million from the newly vested shares including $96.25 million each for CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, and COO Orhan Strum. Environmental Safety Advisor Willem Vasco-Pais also earned $38.5 million.

Though Mr. Sanjorge, Jr. maintains an office in Centrum, the capital of Tethys, most of GAStech International's operations take place on Kronos including production of about 5 million cubic meters of gas daily. Ms. Avila works in GAStech's Centrum headquarters.

Abila Airport fueler Ravi Danisliau confirmed that two private jets took off today after being fueled. 

According to Danisliau, the seven or eight passengers of the first plane were "business types" and appeared to be in a hurry. It was not exactly clear where they were headed. The plane took off around 12:30 local Kronos time. 

The second plane also carried seven or eight "business types", but seemed "much more relaxed than the first group of passengers". Danisliau said the second group of passengers "seemed to be celebrating something." The second plane departed around 14:30 around two hours after the first plane.

Danisliau confirmed that the second plane's destination was Rome, Italy.

Between the two private jets that departed the Abila Airport fourteen to sixteen people could have been passengers. This could easily account for the leadership of GAStech - Kronos. 

When asked whether or not the two planes had anything to do with GAStech International Danisliau replied, "I don't ask a lot questions. I just fuel the planes."

A government investigation has concluded a traffic accident involving a GAStech International vehicle and the vehicle of a family from Elodis resulting in the deaths of the four family members was the result of driver error on the part of the Elodisian driver.

Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said that the investigation found the deadly accident was triggered when the driver from Elodis crossed over into oncoming traffic. Three passengers - Valeria Edris, Celia Edris, and Marcellus Edris - died at the scene.  

Carmine Edris, 9, was found wandering around the accident site. He succumbed to his injuries later at the Abila Hospital. 

The GAStech truck driver received minor injuries and was taken to hospital for observations.

About 25 km West of Abila is the small rural township of Elodis, situated on the Tiskele River. Roughly 20 km upstream is the Tiskele Bend site operated by GAStech International on government-owned land. Townspeople claim the site is contaminating the land and water making their people sick.

In a statement the government of Kronos has denied that the Tiskele Bend site is the source of any contamination insisting that both "natural gas and the drilling process are clean." The statement continued, "If our people are sick we will help them get well. We will find the source of their ailments and do what is required to solve the problem. That is the duty of government: to protect its people."

For its part, GAStech International intends to cooperate fully with the government as it has since the beginning of their relationship.

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

A POK rally designed to bring attention to claims of environmental damage have done more damage to their image. The rally outside of GAStech International's headquarters resulted in multiple arrests for trespassing.

About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, "We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."

Government officials have expressed concern for the "pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos." In response to increased aggression from the POK, additional security will be provided to ensure public safety for all future rallies.

GAStech officials declined to comment at this time indicating an official statement will be issued on the incident.

Last year spontaneous protests and riots broke out around Abila in response to the death of Elian Karel, a Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist. Officials fear a repeat of last year's violent activities around the city on the upcoming anniversary of Karel's death on June 19. 

Government officials issued a brief statement assuring the people of Abila that their "safety is of the utmost importance. Go about your business as usual. Groups like the Protectors of Kronos operate by fear, attempting to change lives and government through fear. Your government will not back down to fear-mongering."

The brief government statement ended there with a promise not to back down to protesters, if there are indeed protests. Hagar Awelon, a shop-owner in Siopa district of Abila heavily impacted by last year's events, responded to the government statement: "They [Government of Kronos] must do more than they did last year. My windows were smashed, my goods destroyed or stolen, and my son was attacked when he defended the store. They must do more."

Protests erupted around the Kronos government buildings, downtown, and elsewhere around Abila eventually escalating into riots and violence. 

The activists are protesting the death yesterday of Elian Karel, a Protector of Kronos (POK) activist who died in jail after being arrested for tax evasion. However, the protests have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops.

Countless shop windows smashed in and around Siopa, the downtown shopping area. A general sense of chaos broke out with chanting protesters, fires, and fleeing citizens. 

A unifying theme of the protesters was the chanted slogans including "Justice for Elian" in reference to previously mentioned activist Elian Karel and "Remember Juliana", a young girl from Elodis who died in 1998 allegedly from the effects of water contamination. Several buildings were defaced with the above mentioned slogans as well.

The Kronos government issued a statement, "This sort of violence will not be condoned. Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other. The Protectors of Kronos must resume peaceful means; all other approaches are unjustifiable."

After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues. However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert. 

The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed. Indeed, "pointing a finger of blame at this time would be hasty and most likely detrimental to the investigation."

Though the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, "The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract."

A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan.

There is still speculation regarding who was taken in the kidnapping and whether GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target, given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago.

At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.

Several instances of rioting in and around Elodis have been reported including the trashing of government buildings, rock throwing, and tire burnings. Police have responded swiftly and decisively. The various skirmishes with police have ended in arrests.

I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life.

TITLE: WHO ARE THE PROTESTERS 

PUBLISHED: 22 August 2012 

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting? 

The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. 

In 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. 

Also in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since. 

The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel's death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence. 

The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a "public threat".

1020 UPDATE - People streamed out of the GAStech - Kronos headquarters about 5 minutes ago. There seemed to be much confusion and given the large corporate gathering today, this writer has doubts that it was a fire drill. Perhaps an actual fire or a bomb threat could have caused the evacuation.SOURCE: The Abila Post

TITLE: DRUG RELATED ARRESTS ON THE RISE
 
PUBLISHED: 14 May 2011

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

An alarming new trend is sweeping Abila. Police point out a dramatic increase in drug related arrests that may be linked to violent activist groups. 

The port of Abila is known to be a transshipment point for drugs coming from the Middle East and Africa going to Europe namely heroin and hashish. However, drug related arrests had remained flat over the past decade until the recent increase. 

The concerns over the increase of drug related arrests are two-fold: first, violent activist groups such as the Protectors of Kronos could be using drug sales as a means to fund their activities; and second, with more drugs appearing on the shore, the people of Kronos will suffer increased drug related issues, namely addiction and violence.

LOCATION: ELODIS, Kronos 

The international healthy water awareness group Wellness for All (WFA) have performed testing on the local water in Elodis finding high level of hazardous materials in residential water wells. 

In a statement released by WFA, the group directs blame to the Government of Kronos and GAStech International, a natural gas company from Tethys. In addition to directing blame WFA also demands that the two clean up the contamination, which includes high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium.

By bringing attention to the contamination in and around Elodis, WFA expects the international community will pressure the Government of Kronos into action. Additionally, WFA has been working with the activist group Protectors of Kronos to lobby the government to apply pressure.

TITLE: TISKELE BEND EXPLOSION AND FIRE

PUBLISHED: 16 August 2000

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

A spark at the GAStech International-owned well at the Tiskele Bend site ignited methane gas several hundred feet underground, causing a fireball and fire that burned for about an hour is the findings from a dual GAStech - government investigation of the explosion and subsequent fire Sunday morning. 

Four GAStech employees suffered injuries including minor burns and broken bones. In contrast to previous reports there were no deaths and none missing as a result of the incident. No local residents were injured as well and though some residents of Elodis were evacuated from their homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary. 

While the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself. GAStech's wellheads are ringed with collars that have set pins running through them. One of the pins may have blown out of the collar, releasing the gas, which then came in contact with a spark.

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

The Kronos Government has labeled the Protectors of Kronos (POK) as a threat to the public. In a statement by government spokesman Rufus Drymiau the POK are described as "justifiably a public threat due to violent demonstrations, opportunistic vandalism, and clashes with the police."

A shop owner in the Siopa district, who declined to be named, responded to the government labeling the POK a public threat: "I agree they are a public threat. Every time they come around they bring their signs and then they smash windows. We try to fight, but there are too many and they steal our things. My business suffers because of the Protectors."

Officer Emilio Haber, who patrols the Siopa district, said of the POK, "They smash the windows. They throw the rocks. They chant for change and paint things on buildings. They make themselves look stupid and then we arrest them and put them in jail where they belong."

TITLE: GASTECH LEADERSHIP CONFIRMED MISSING
PUBLISHED: By Haneson Ngohebo

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

Miriam Avila, an administrative assistant at GAStech International, has confirmed that members of the GAStech leadership are in fact missing. The group was expected to arrive at the Government reception following this morning's meeting at GAStech - Kronos headquarters, but never showed up.

Ms. Avila denied that any GAStech employee has been abducted. She also denied that they had simply skipped town with their newfound riches.

As The World reported on 16 December 2013, GAStech International's recent initial public offering (IPO) netted Sten Sanjorge, Jr. an eye-popping $1.96 billion for his controlling share of the international gas drilling and exploration company. 

The GAStech - Kronos leadership was also handsomely rewarded. The IPO filings show that the executive group earned a collective $327.25 million from the newly vested shares including $96.25 million each for CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, and COO Orhan Strum. Environmental Safety Advisor Willem Vasco-Pais also earned $38.5 million.

Though Mr. Sanjorge, Jr. maintains an office in Centrum, the capital of Tethys, most of GAStech International's operations take place on Kronos including production of about 5 million cubic meters of gas daily. Ms. Avila works in GAStech's Centrum headquarters.

TITLE: ABILA AIRPORT CONFIRMS TWO PRIVATE JETS LEFT TODAY

PUBLISHED: 20 January 2014

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

Abila Airport fueler Ravi Danisliau confirmed that two private jets took off today after being fueled. 

According to Danisliau, the seven or eight passengers of the first plane were "business types" and appeared to be in a hurry. It was not exactly clear where they were headed. The plane took off around 12:30 local Kronos time. 

The second plane also carried seven or eight "business types", but seemed "much more relaxed than the first group of passengers". Danisliau said the second group of passengers "seemed to be celebrating something." The second plane departed around 14:30 around two hours after the first plane.

Danisliau confirmed that the second plane's destination was Rome, Italy.

Between the two private jets that departed the Abila Airport fourteen to sixteen people could have been passengers. This could easily account for the leadership of GAStech - Kronos. 

When asked whether or not the two planes had anything to do with GAStech International Danisliau replied, "I don't ask a lot questions. I just fuel the planes."

A government investigation has concluded a traffic accident involving a GAStech International vehicle and the vehicle of a family from Elodis resulting in the deaths of the four family members was the result of driver error on the part of the Elodisian driver.

Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said that the investigation found the deadly accident was triggered when the driver from Elodis crossed over into oncoming traffic. Three passengers - Valeria Edris, Celia Edris, and Marcellus Edris - died at the scene.  

Carmine Edris, 9, was found wandering around the accident site. He succumbed to his injuries later at the Abila Hospital.

LOCATION: ELODIS, Kronos 

About 25 km West of Abila is the small rural township of Elodis, situated on the Tiskele River. Roughly 20 km upstream is the Tiskele Bend site operated by GAStech International on government-owned land. Townspeople claim the site is contaminating the land and water making their people sick.

In a statement the government of Kronos has denied that the Tiskele Bend site is the source of any contamination insisting that both "natural gas and the drilling process are clean." The statement continued, "If our people are sick we will help them get well. We will find the source of their ailments and do what is required to solve the problem. That is the duty of government: to protect its people."

For its part, GAStech International intends to cooperate fully with the government as it has since the beginning of their relationship.

TITLE: GASTECH HEADQUARTERS BLOCKED BY POK

PUBLISHED: 19 February 2009

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

A POK rally designed to bring attention to claims of environmental damage have done more damage to their image. The rally outside of GAStech International's headquarters resulted in multiple arrests for trespassing.

About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, "We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."

Government officials have expressed concern for the "pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos." In response to increased aggression from the POK, additional security will be provided to ensure public safety for all future rallies.

GAStech officials declined to comment at this time indicating an official statement will be issued on the incident.

Last year spontaneous protests and riots broke out around Abila in response to the death of Elian Karel, a Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist. Officials fear a repeat of last year's violent activities around the city on the upcoming anniversary of Karel's death on June 19. 

Government officials issued a brief statement assuring the people of Abila that their "safety is of the utmost importance. Go about your business as usual. Groups like the Protectors of Kronos operate by fear, attempting to change lives and government through fear. Your government will not back down to fear-mongering."

The brief government statement ended there with a promise not to back down to protesters, if there are indeed protests. Hagar Awelon, a shop-owner in Siopa district of Abila heavily impacted by last year's events, responded to the government statement: "They [Government of Kronos] must do more than they did last year. My windows were smashed, my goods destroyed or stolen, and my son was attacked when he defended the store. They must do more."

The brazen day time assault on two peace officers by the POK is just another violent, terroristic act in a long string of such acts. The two officers were left bloody and beaten, and tied up in the trunk of their vandalized vehicle.

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said of the attack, "Assaulting a police officer and destroying government property are serious crimes. I want to assure the public that these men will be caught and brought to justice soon." 

Further exacerbating the situation, the two criminals defaced the officers' car by spray painting the POK logo. 

If they can attack two police officers in broad daylight, who is next?
