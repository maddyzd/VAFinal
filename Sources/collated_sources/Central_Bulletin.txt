LOCATION: ELODIS, Kronos 

The Protectors of Kronos (POK) continue to protest against the Kronos Government and GAStech International alleging pollution, water contamination and a lack of a government response. Lately the protests have turned violent escalating into rioting largely directed at the Tiskele Bend site. After the recent rioting, government officials had no choice, but to round up the protesters and arrest them for trespassing. 

Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau commented, "These sort of violent actions by members of the Protectors of Kronos are counterproductive. We are working closely - the government and GAStech - to ensure that all environmental issues are resolved." 

Several instances of rioting in and around Elodis have been reported including the trashing of government buildings, rock throwing, and tire burnings.

ABILA, Kronos - The Kronos Government has labeled the Protectors of Kronos (POK) as a threat to the public. In a statement by government spokesman Rufus Drymiau the POK are described as "justifiably a public threat due to violent demonstrations, opportunistic vandalism, and clashes with the police." 

A shop owner in the Siopa district, who declined to be named, responded to the government labeling the POK a public threat: "I agree they are a public threat. Every time they come around they bring their signs and then they smash windows. 

Officer Emilio Haber, who patrols the Siopa district, said of the POK, "They smash the windows. They make themselves look stupid and then we arrest them and put them in jail where they belong."

For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member. 

Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, "I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the police or the government for not leaving any stone unturned.

After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues. However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert.  

The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed. 

Though the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, "The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract."

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

ABILA, Kronos - With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters?  

The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since.  

 The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  

The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a "public threat".

A POK rally designed to bring attention to claims of environmental damage have done more damage to their image. The rally outside of GAStech International's headquarters resulted in multiple arrests for trespassing. 

About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work. 

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, "We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."

A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago. Edvard Vann, a GAStech Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events. 

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office.

Four GAStech employees suffered injuries including minor burns and broken bones. No local residents were injured as well and though some residents of Elodis were evacuated from their homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary.  

While the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself. GAStech's wellheads are ringed with collars that have set pins running through them.
