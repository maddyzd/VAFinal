TITLE: DRILLING TECHNIQUE BANNED IN TETHYS

PUBLISHED: 30 March 1995

LOCATION: CENTRUM, Tethys 

GAStech International's Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal (HASR) has officially been banned by the Tethys government due to the high probability of water contamination. 

GAStech developed the innovative drilling technique in 1974 proved quite successful for the extraction of gas, but the technique's environmental impact is deemed unacceptable by the Tethys government due to the high probability of water table contamination from waste products produced during the HASR process.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr. responded to the ban saying, "So be it. Tethys' loss will be another country's gain."

TITLE: GASTECH ADOPTS NEW LOGO

LOCATION: CENTRUM, Tethys 

 With great fanfare GAStech International's President and CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr. revealed the company's new logo, part of the company's rebranding process. 

During the press conference Sanjorge, Jr. spoke of the new logo - a tri-part blue flame - that is reminiscent of a leaf to "help position GAStech and its products as a clean fuel alternative." He also referenced that the tri-part flame represents the past, present, and future of the company in that by keeping "one eye on the past we know from where we came - our humble beginnings; one eye on the future we will know where we are going - our coming success; and both feet planted in the present we will be proactive in an ever-changing, competitive industry."

Finally, Sanjorge, Jr. asserted GAStech International's "blue flame is an enduring beacon of environmental responsibility, and a symbol of a clean energy business moving forward." 

This rebranding process and new logo seem to be in response to recent trouble the multi-national gas giant has been struggling with in Kronos including the February 19 protest at GAStech - Kronos' headquarters of 200 people who blocked entrance to the building, resulting in several arrests. The protest and others in and around Abila, the capital of Kronos, have been in response to alleged water contamination issues and a lack of Government and GAStech response.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr. declined to comment directly on questions regarding protests and environmental contamination. He deflected, "Today is a great day for GAStech. I won't let the day be derailed by unfounded, borderline libelous, allegations."

The real gross domestic product - the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in Kronos - increased at an annual rate of 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 1999, according to the advance estimate released by the Bureau of Economics.

This marks the 5th year in a row with positive GDP growth for the developing country. Most of this growth can be contributed to the relationship between the Government of Kronos and GAStech International.

The healthy water awareness group, Wellness for All (WFA), has condemned both GAStech International and the Government of Kronos. WFA's statement claims widespread groundwater contamination, a lack of adequate safeguards, clean-up demands being ignored and no government oversight.

The Government of Kronos, when contacted, declined to comment. 

However, GAStech International's Environmental Safety Advisor Ingmar Casablancas responded to the claims, "The alleged charges levied against GAStech International are unfounded. GAStech International and the Government of Kronos cooperate tirelessly to ensure a clean, safe, and prosperous work place. We are both devoted to the preservation of the environment."

GAStech International has shifted its focus from Tethys to the small Mediterranean island of Kronos and the vast gas deposits beneath the ground.

Recent charges of groundwater contamination against GAStech International and tightening environmental regulations lead by the Tethan Interior Minister, Ivar Blanes, certainly play into the shifting focus. 

With environmental regulation lax to nonexistent in Kronos and a friendly local government, GAStech's move feels inevitable in hindsight.

TITLE: KIDNAPPING AT GASTECH KRONOS 

PUBLISHED: 20 January 2014

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

After a long day of conflicting and confusing information reports are still sketchy, but the story is beginning to come clear: a Kronos Government source has confirmed up to fourteen of GAStech International's employees may have been kidnapped at the company's headquarters in Abila. 

Much speculation remains regarding who was taken in the kidnapping. Speculation includes whether or not GAStech International President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motivation behind the kidnapping has also been rampant due to the recent GAStech IPO.

At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, indicated the Protectors of Kronos were suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation, aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.

January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting. At some point while company officers were transitioning from the main office to a Kronos Government reception the abductions took place. 

Unconfirmed reports of a fire at the office may have served as a distraction for the kidnappers or at least contributed to the confusion during the event. Abila Fire Department trucks were dispatched to GAStech - Kronos headquarters around 10:00 this morning local Kronos time to respond to a fire alarm.

With his trademark flash, Sten Sanjorge, Jr. President of GAStech International opened the new GAStech-Kronos headquarters. The ribbon was cut with a huge pair of scissors, matched in size only by Sanjorge Jr.'s smile. 

The 50 million dollar price tag for the new headquarters is just a drop in the bucket for GAStech. The gas field in production outside of Abila has exceeded even Sanjorge's oversized expectations, paying for the building many times over. 

Present at the ribbon cutting ceremony were several representatives from the Kronos Government.

An explosion at a nearby gas drilling well pad woke Rebecca Cato around 3 a.m. on Sunday morning. When she left her home in Elodis, Kronos - a rural township outside the capital Abila - to investigate the noise she noticed a large fire coming from GAStech International's Tiskele Bend site.

The GAStech-owned well near Elodis ignited methane gas underground causing a fire that lasted for around an hour. At least four GAStech employees appeared to have been taken away by ambulance; however, GAStech has declined to comment on the extent and nature of their injuries. 

GAStech's CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. downplayed the event stating, "This event could hardly be described as an explosion," but merely a common practice referred to as flaring. He continued, "I won't bore you with the details, but a temporary flare is often used during well production testing." 

Mrs. Cato and other locals from Elodis were turned away by GAStech employees and government officials. Eventually, locals downriver were evacuated. Rebecca Cato said, "After sending us away without a single question answered, they came to our doors and told us to leave our homes. It was the middle of the night where was I to go."

Hank Fluss, COO of GAStech International, died of a heart attack at his desk in the company's downtown Centrum headquarters. Though Fluss was 73 years old, his death came as a shock.

Hank Fluss spent 40 years with GAStech, befriending Sten Sanjorge, Sr. in 1963 when the two started out on their own. As wildcatters, they began drilling in areas not previously known to be gas fields. After many failed wells and on the brink of financial ruin, Fluss and Sanjorge, Sr. pressed on eventually finding one of the largest untapped gas fields in Tethys.

As Chief Operating Officer, Fluss has overseen GAStech's expansion, truly making it an international company and growing it into a multi-billion dollar operation. Always a champion of environmental causes, Fluss had become increasingly disenchanted with the GAStech - Kronos operation straining his relationship with CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr. 

Hank Fluss is survived by his wife of 54 years, Beatriz Fluss, his 5 children, and 12 grandchildren.

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

The Government of Kronos is currently planning some of the world's most generous tax breaks for gas investments. This will help create "cheap energy" that can give the developing country a competitive advantage and a leg up in the government's push to modernize.

As high-income countries from Europe and the United States race to take advantage of existing and potential gas deposits, Kronos is planning to provide incentives such as reducing corporate and individual tax, preferential tariffs, and derogations from regulations as well as cheap, but eager work force.

The Government of Kronos is pitching the plan as a win-win situation given that the high-income countries will be struggling to discover and exploit ever-dwindling supplies of fossil-fuels and the developing Kronos needs income, infrastructure, and cheap energy.

Look for energy companies to flock to Kronos.

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

As part of the government brokered deal with GAStech International, Abila must make upgrades to their deep water port. When gas production ramps up, the Port's traffic is expected to increase ten-fold. 

The proposed upgrades include raising Abila's East Pier in phases, a massive $300 million project that will accommodate new, larger container ships. Currently the East Pier is roughly 3 meters above sea level and must be raised to 8 meters. Additionally, the Port will need to dredge the port killing two birds with one stone: increasing the depth of the port and providing fill to raise the East Pier.

Port of Abila's Director Claudio Morluniau applauded the deal saying that the additional port capacity will open doors for import and export trade. "This deal and the port expansion is the introduction of Kronos to the world!"

The groundbreaking today at the Tiskele Bend site marks another flag planted in foreign soil by GAStech International. Sten Sanjorge Jr.'s international expansion has been the hallmark of his brief tenure at the helm following his father's death in February of this year.

"Today is great day for the People of Kronos. With the jobs, and the cheaper and cleaner fuel provided by GAStech you can begin to live the lives you deserve."

On the heels of GAStech's expansion into Asteria, the Tiskele Bend site has the potential to dwarf any of GAStech's other gas fields. Conservative estimates of preliminary test well results place the Tiskele Bend field at least on par with the largest of GAStech's Tethan fields.
