I was contacted a short time ago by members of the Protectors of Kronos social action movement to convey a very important message to the people of Kronos.  The POK was forced to go to great lengths to in order to communicate with you without hindrance from the government.  A representative contacted me and asked me to carry their message to you.  To protect my safety they picked me up from a public location, blindfolded me and drove me to a location that even I do not recognize.

A measure to increase taxes on foreign oil and gas development proposed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola was defeated by a wide margin last week in the General Assembly.
This defeat is a harsh blow to the Protectors of Kronos, an Elodis group that was counting on this funding to provide healthcare and environment cleanup of their drinking and irrigation water.
"We have a meeting planned with the Minister," Protectors of Kronos leader Henk Bodrogi told the Homeland Illumination.  "Don't count us out yet.  We plan to improve the measure and Minister Nespola will reintroduce it later this year."
Bodrogi is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, a grassroots environmental group with a mission to reverse the pollution caused by gas drilling in his hometown.

Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free.
Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel’s death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police –whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death – would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.
This “thorough investigation” lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel’s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel’s death stating that “we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.”
As reported at the time of Karel’s death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel’s body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact.
Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel’s death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.
Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.  
“Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,” one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  “Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?”
Another, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  “Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!”

In a touching ceremony Wednesday leaders of the activist group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen leader, Elian Karel, who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a Kronos jail.
"Today we gather to remember Elian Karel," Silvia Marek told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor.
"Elian was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and Antaura Karel.  He grew up with the specter of death all around him.   By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann."
Marek paused a moment to allow the cries of "Remember Juliana!" to fade.
"Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life.  Yet he chose to take those steps despite the challenges he knew he would face."
"Elian's journey ended three years ago today.  But his dream did not die with him.  And it is that vision of a healthy and prosperous future for all we are here today to honor."
Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials. 
The gathering was marred only by the aggravating presence of Abila police in riot gear.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.

Yesterday, as they have each June 19th for the past three years supporters of Protectors of Kronos rallied demanding much the same as they have in the past fourteen years:  an end to the corruption of the Kronos government officials and the cleanup of the toxic waste dump that has become the Tiskele River near Elodis. 
The rally which took place at several venues across the city, including in front of President Kapelou's publically-owned home and in front of the Abila capital building.  The citizens gathered hoping their voices would be heard by their elected officials. They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.
On everyone's mind was the question:  Who brings a gun to a peaceful sit in?  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water.  
Why did the Kronos government feel the need to send a police brute squad?
Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.  Flyers bringing messages of truth and justice were left on park benches, in coffee houses and on light poles.  
How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?

Earlier this year a series Homeland Illumination published a series of articles about groundwater contamination in Elodis, and how the locals are demanding a government response for what is essentially Government of Kronos-sponsored pollution and poisoning of citizens.  This article is an update.
ELODIS, Kronos - Ten-year old Juliana Vann died yesterday afternoon, surrounded by her family and friends.  The cause of death was leukemia due to benzene poisoning.
Juliana had been sick for over a year.  Initially her family didn't realize that benzene poisoning was the cause of Juliana's problems.  After visits to many hospitals, a doctor associated with the international assistance organization Wellness For All recommended Juliana be tests for benzene poisoning.  At that point, however, the little girl's system was too damaged to recover.
The residents of Elodis have been pleading with the government of Kronos to take action against the pollution caused by the GAStech gas drilling operation just 20 km upstream from Elodis.
Juliana's death is but one of several deaths this rural township has suffered because of toxic waste being dumped into the Tiskele River by Tethys corporation GAStech.
Private funeral services will be held on August 21 in the family home.

In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.  He was led - manacled – from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in Elodis, a rural township outside Abila.
Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, “I guess I shouldn’t have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday.”
Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community.
“We didn’t ask for GAStech to come to our community,” Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  “We didn’t’ ask for our water to become undrinkable, for our children to become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?”
The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.
“He’s a determined man,” Karel’s attorney Michale Kraft told me over the phone. “He’ll fight these false charges and be out in a few days.  He’ll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally.” 
Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning.

This article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.
Pondo Reese, editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, stands at his window, looking out toward the sun setting on the Tiskele River.  I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food.
"It took a long time for anyone to respond," Reese tells me of their struggle.  "Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn't give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.    Henk and a few other residents made several trips to Abila trying to get someone to listen.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that's where we started."
Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records.
"It's been frustrating.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We're currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance."
Has it been worth it?
"You tell me," Reese nods out his window.  I look over his shoulder to see a group of children kicking a soccer ball in the dust.
"What choice do we have?"

 "We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more," Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  "Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy."
Busy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more.
"I usually head to the fields before sun up," Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. "My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark."
"We do this most days," he adds, "except for worship days."
Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase.
"We all know one another here," Bodrogi explains as we leave. "Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back."
I ask Bodrogi if business has been good. 
"We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops."
In what way, I asked.
"The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated."
Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town.
The water specialist turned out to be the international agency "Wellness For All", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development.
I caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for "Wellness for All".  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.
"We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. "
"Can these substances occur naturally?" I asked her.
"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops."
"Did you talk to GAStech about this?"
"Oh yes," she replied.  "At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment."
Sten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.
"When we didn't make headway with GAStech," Reynolds continued, "the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized."
At this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.

At the request of the citizens of Elodis, Wellness for All has published a report on the impact of gas drilling operations on water quality and public health.  The full report will soon be available on the Wellness for All website.  Comparative data prior to 1998 was obtained from a thorough investigating of medical record provided by Elodis Community Health Center.
Report Highlights
* Elevated amounts of toxic chemicals were found in the water supply, including arsenic, acetic anhydride, benzene, and chlorine dioxide.
* Persons younger than 30 appear to be suffering an unusually high rate of chronic illness associated with toxins produced by gas drilling operations.

Government heavies obstructed the free speech - yet again - of members of the activist group Protectors of Kronos yesterday at a lawful demonstration at the Tiskele Bend fields.  The five POK activists had gathered in front of the gates to GAStech gas drilling operations facility to bring public awareness about the polluted Tiskele River which has caused health problems to the residents of Elodis.
Bystanders report that the demonstration had begun peacefully with the five POK members walking back and forth across the road, chanting "Remember Juliana!" and "No more poison!"  
An eyewitness told the Homeland Illumination that when the gates opened to allow GAStech company vehicles to exit the facility the protesters moved aside.  Witnesses agree that at the same time vehicles with the Government of Kronos seal drove to the gates, apparently planning to enter the facility. 
"It was all very civil up till then," Griffith Mabel, an Elodis resident who had come out to support the POK told the Homeland Illumination.   "The gates opened, the POK people moved and the trucks drove out.  That's when it got weird.  The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for no reason."
Another eyewitness, Elodis farmer Charley Normand adds, "Yeah, the POK guys asked the drivers to move nicely, but the GAStech drivers ignored them.  They had their windows down, so it wasn't like they couldn't hear them."
The occupants of the government vehicles exited and joined the altercation.  The sequence of events becomes confusing at this point.  Some witnesses state the GAStech drivers instigated arguments with the protestors, and others think the government officials began to strong arm the protesters from the road.
"Turns out the people in the government cars were police," Mabel tells the Homeland Illumination.  "They wore uniforms and had badges."
Onlookers tell the Homeland Illumination that the three parties began yelling, and at some point the Kronos police - presumably from Abila-  arrested the five activists and transported them to an Elodis jail.
Despite repeated requests for an interview, the Homeland Illumination has not been granted access to those arrested.

In a glitzy press conference late last year President Luis Araullo announced a historic set of tax incentives intended to bring foreign investment to Kronos under the guise creating jobs, providing cheap energy and building infrastructure.  Following the 86-14 vote last month the Minister of the Interior Tomas Sarto lauded the decision as "landmark" and "bettering the people".
We shall see.  The crafters of these revolutionary measures neglected to include a detailed plan about how this windfall would benefit everyday Kronosians.  When the first payment from these foreign company lands in the state coffers, how will these funds be dispersed?
One wonders:  Did the 14 who opposed the measure feel the same way?  Were they also wondering exactly how this money would be funneled into education, improvements in roads, utilities and healthcare?
Calls to the offices of the President were not returned.

A vehicle collision claimed the lives of an Elodis family, including two children Tuesday afternoon.  The family was traveling home from a school program where one of the children had performed in the Spring Program at Elodis Primary School.

Elodis Assistant Police Commissioner Adian Koppolis reported three of the victims died at the scene of the accident.  Marcellus Edris, 33, his wife Valeria, 30, their daughter Celia, 7 died at the scene of the accident.  A son, Carmine, survived the initial collision but died later at an Abila hospital.

The unidentified 25-year old driver of the GAStech truck was held overnight in the Elodis city jail, and then released.

Initial reports from the investigators state the truck driver had illegally entered the intersection where he had failed to halt at a stop sign, while the other vehicle had the right of way.

Commissioner Koppolis said Elodis police would conduct a full investigation.

This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.
ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt. Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.
Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate.
"We didn't make the connection at first," Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  "The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed."
The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.
Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.
With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a café where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.
"We've made a good living for a long time," Reese tells me. "The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here."
I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  
I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos

Elian Karel, age 28, died Friday while unlawfully incarcerated at the Abila City Prison.  Karel was being held on fraudulent tax evasion charges after his arrest on March 12 earlier this year.
His attorney, Michale Kraft made the announcement Friday during a noon press conference.
"We don't know any details yet.  What I can tell you is that when I left Elian yesterday after meeting with him in the prison he was in excellent health and good spirits.  He was expecting to be released in the next few days and return to his work with the Protectors of Kronos, and was excited to continue the Protectors of Kronos mission to which he dedicated his life.  I can assure you that Elian's death will be investigated with all the resources at our disposal and those responsible will be brought to justice."
Supporters of the POK and others began gathering outside the police station as news spread.
"I can't believe it," Kriste Brontes said through her tears, "We were at the rally in March.  He looked and sounded so good.  He was so optimistic that changes were coming.  Who will be able to lead POK now?"
Karel, from Elodis, had been involved with the POK mission since he was young.  He was only a few years older than Juliana Vann, a friend who died in 1998 of toxin poisoning caused by illegal dumping from the Tethyn company GAStech. 
Calls to the President's office, the office of the Minister of Justice and the office of the Chief of Police were not immediately returned.

TITLE: POK RALLY DRAWS THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos

Thousands of protesters carrying banners reading "Remember Juliana!" and chanting "We want truth!" rallied in front of the Kronos government offices Saturday morning. Protesters were demanding an accounting of the government revenues from then President Araullo's tax incentives that were signed into law in 1993.
Ten-year old Juliana Vann died in 1998 from an illness caused by contaminated water from GAStech drilling operations. She has become the heart-rending icon of a movement that has gained support from one end of Kronos to the other.
"We were promised better jobs, new roads, better healthcare and a better standard of living," said one 20-year old protestor who declined to have her name used.  "All I see are bigger mansions for the ministers and a hospital that costs more to fix than it can make.  We won't accept that!"
The protestor was referring to Abila General Hospital built in 1997 ostensibly with money from the increased revenue from the foreign gas operations here on Kronos.  The non-profit hospital has had difficulty maintaining its infrastructure, despite the extensive restoration performed sevearl years ago to replace the electrical and plumbing systems.
"The contracts were all given to family and cronies of the ministers," accuses 26-year old Jon L., who traveled six hours to attend yesterday's rally.  "What we need is transparency in our government.  We need to know what happens to all the money coming in from these foreign companies.
Protest leader Elian Karel addressed the demonstrators at Abila City park.  Karel took over POK leadership from Henk Bodrogi, whose ill health forced him down from the position.  Karel spoke eloquently about the beginnings of the POK campaign as a grassroots effort for clean water, to the dynamic movement it has become demanding improved government transparency and accountability.
"We aren't asking for anything unreasonable," Karel speaks passionately to his ardent listeners.  "All we want is to know how our taxes are being used.  We know these corporations are generating records profits at the expense of Kronos, but we see none of the promised improvements.  All we want is accountability for those who died because of greed, corruption and disregard of those who they should be protecting."
Calls to the President's office were not immediately returned.

One year ago today a young man in search of a brighter future for his countrymen died in a cold, cement prison.  He was attended only by apathetic guards who had been charged with detaining him pending an investigation for tax fraud.  Instead, sometime in the early morning hours of 19 June, Elian Karel died with injuries inexplicable with the official cause of death.
The report released by the Abila City Coroner in July 2010 attributed Karel's death to sudden cardiac arrest, and the investigation was closed shortly thereafter.  Unnamed sources close to the investigation, however, have provided witness testimony that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which occurred within hours before his death.
Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.
In the year since Karel's death the Protectors of Kronos have continued the mission to demand that the Kronos government implement a policy of transparency in government business, and to hold accountable the foreign companies that have contaminated Kronosian natural resources.
Supporters continue to mass in public places, determined that their cries for justice be heard.  Now intermixed with chants of "Remember Juliana!" one can also hear cries "Remember Elian!"
