TITLE: The insight of an expert: thriving as foreign CEO in Kronos 

PUBLISHED: 2014/03/26
17 January 1995



The strict Fluss are CEO of GAStech, the important industry of Krono more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gasvelden near the city of Elodis.

Fluss, have worked with dozens of foreign CEOs in the course of the years. However, he has records beginning as oil and gasprospector in Tethys. 

He spoke to The Times concerning the appetites of a successful LEADER in Kronos and which foreign CEOs in the market can expect. 

Q: What is possible foreign CEOs when they to Kronos expects come?

A: The economic environment has changed for the eighties. It is succeed much today more with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The competition under Kronosian and foreign firms is tough. It is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the population.

But there is less difference than people between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian. The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful of their work and has same the wish for success. They know also it how at to appreciate efficient communication and a gifted LEADER.

What a foreign LEADER must do is learns how at to communicate Kronosian to the manner and time to demand to understand their staff.

Q: Can you develop?

A: There are a lot of cultural differences in communicating. [Think] after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in Kronos] and simple yes/no expect answer. In place of it they become a very long answer to that their initial question does not answer.

People of Kronos love the no responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their job and do not love in saying something are forced they to wants. Foreign need CEOs this take into account and the time to have demand to understand how at to communicate.

Patience is very important. Transparency can be an excellent get manner around this. It is a European value that Kronosians to very receptive is. Imposing in a company can turn foreign CEO into the travel in Kronos a more pleasant experience.

Q: What are the most important challenges foreign CEO can on arrival in Kronos under eyes see?

ri

A: Sometimes it is the simple things that can be the challenge, such as getting A to B in a taxi. Are able round to be easily taken for granted and cannot do creërt this a large meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as your driver you on the planned address sale. This is possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it is very tiring.

Another get to know your team and which you work with. Frequently foreign CEOs right to walk of the plane and in an office peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This can be confusing. 

The need of CEOs demand the time to speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck drivers and their new environment to understand before they try and them lead.

Q: Can you give a couple ends on how foreign CEO can preparations make?

A: The first thing which I am your prepare family would say. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new work surroundings. This can influence it personal life. Mixing family and the work is here very common practice. People of Kronos work overtime and socializing with their colleagues it is very differing from Tethys where there is a clear border between the work and family.

Foreign CEOs also must realize how tough are the competition and how much hard work must be introduced to succeed -- frequently much more than in their birth country. The language is a large question.

[But] no question how much you prepare, real experience will surprise in Kronos to work and live you always.

Q: How difficult - or easy - is it for foreign CEO in Kronos to be?

A: Generally, think I am CEO hard am. There is a lot very, is the environment tough and it is difficult find a balance with your personal life.

When a team hears Kronos that CEO come assume from overseas she is it a problem. But culturally they have no question with aliens. 

Q: There are situations in which it are a foreign staff employee in fact an advantage is?

A: This question depends really on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and culture. If they make no effort then to localize is it a net disadvantage. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as luxury goods, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring to a another view, the process to facilitate.

Sometimes foreign CEO better knowledge of the industry have and can access to markets overseas bring. This can be real assets.

Of course, to people good reasons necessary in the hostile distant areas come and have worked Kronosian. They become to provide with medical care, recreation, and food.

For staff employees, it puts an overview, marble-lined a medical and therapy center in functioning.

Beside each of these perks, is there also posts of TV GAStech, which claims be not even unbiased. It must serve the will of the company there.

The picture of a modern overall company hardly seems, since the most of those unceremoniously have dumped their not fundamental activities. There is an argument, however, which the energy matter differing from other industries be, which energy companies require to work in several manners.

Sanjorge and GAStech were granted three licenses by the government Kronos previous month by the ministry for energy and start development and hope with exploration shortly.

The certain gas are no new concept, but there are not no reason The Times told with the history Kronosian of sea development that we these resources can develop for the coast, he.

he gas of the shale is obtained the using controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate disposal which involves injecting acidic the layers of the chemical productenschalie, to break them apart and within gas locked up it rather to give.

Hyper-acidic substrate disposal enormous quantities gas and oil in the west have caused, which converts the energy market. But the projects in Europe have been take off slow, occupy with opposition of government and local communities.

Sanjorge say it a short time will be before we knowing or are possible the shale gas become exploitable.

A lot of environment experts believe that hyper-acidic substrate disposal can marine damage themselves environments, and the avulsion of new fossile fuel resources resists himself. But boring for the coast avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local Councils, communities and landowners.

Based on existing geological data, SanJorge that believe a considerable quantity gas at its place - until 100 trillion cubic foot are, which would be more than the estimates of GAStech for its coast resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.

GAStech that has valued Kronos the total sea resources of the shale gas between five 10 times the size of resources available coast could be.

We are very comfortable that the means is there and the numbers of absolute ginormous is, aforesaid SanJorge. Is no matter which of that workable? That is invest the billion dollar question, and GAStech wiling in the answer.

Although it has become only recently controversial, hyper-acidic substrate disposal have been used on small-scale a lot of years, to improve conventional oil and gas well to the flow of. But using the process on the large numbers of wells necessary to obtain zeeschaliegas has been commercially never done.

Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical concerning or to the shale gas a large employee to European energy in the next decade could be, but will say that potentially was possible in the longer term have.

GAStech are optimistic are its estimates of how long it will last to examine shale. It is completely plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, hyper-acidic will have this way progressed the technology of the substrate disposal and the manner in which we treat the sea environment this way will have progressed that this the really large industry could be.

TITLE: The insight of an expert: thriving as foreign CEO in Kronos 

PUBLISHED: 2014/03/26
17 January 1995



The strict Fluss are CEO of GAStech, the important industry of Krono more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gasvelden near the city of Elodis.

Fluss, have worked with dozens of foreign CEOs in the course of the years. However, he has records beginning as oil and gasprospector in Tethys. 

He spoke to The Times concerning the appetites of a successful LEADER in Kronos and which foreign CEOs in the market can expect. 

Q: What is possible foreign CEOs when they to Kronos expects come?

A: The economic environment has changed for the eighties. It is succeed much today more with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The competition under Kronosian and foreign firms is tough. It is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the population.

But there is less difference than people between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian. The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful of their work and has same the wish for success. They know also it how at to appreciate efficient communication and a gifted LEADER.

What a foreign LEADER must do is learns how at to communicate Kronosian to the manner and time to demand to understand their staff.

Q: Can you develop?

A: There are a lot of cultural differences in communicating. [Think] after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in Kronos] and simple yes/no expect answer. In place of it they become a very long answer to that their initial question does not answer.

People of Kronos love the no responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their job and do not love in saying something are forced they to wants. Foreign need CEOs this take into account and the time to have demand to understand how at to communicate.

Patience is very important. Transparency can be an excellent get manner around this. It is a European value that Kronosians to very receptive is. Imposing in a company can turn foreign CEO into the travel in Kronos a more pleasant experience.

Q: What are the most important challenges foreign CEO can on arrival in Kronos under eyes see?

ri

A: Sometimes it is the simple things that can be the challenge, such as getting A to B in a taxi. Are able round to be easily taken for granted and cannot do creërt this a large meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as your driver you on the planned address sale. This is possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it is very tiring.

Another get to know your team and which you work with. Frequently foreign CEOs right to walk of the plane and in an office peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This can be confusing. 

The need of CEOs demand the time to speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck drivers and their new environment to understand before they try and them lead.

Q: Can you give a couple ends on how foreign CEO can preparations make?

A: The first thing which I am your prepare family would say. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new work surroundings. This can influence it personal life. Mixing family and the work is here very common practice. People of Kronos work overtime and socializing with their colleagues it is very differing from Tethys where there is a clear border between the work and family.

Foreign CEOs also must realize how tough are the competition and how much hard work must be introduced to succeed -- frequently much more than in their birth country. The language is a large question.

[But] no question how much you prepare, real experience will surprise in Kronos to work and live you always.

Q: How difficult - or easy - is it for foreign CEO in Kronos to be?

A: Generally, think I am CEO hard am. There is a lot very, is the environment tough and it is difficult find a balance with your personal life.

When a team hears Kronos that CEO come assume from overseas she is it a problem. But culturally they have no question with aliens. 

Q: There are situations in which it are a foreign staff employee in fact an advantage is?

A: This question depends really on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and culture. If they make no effort then to localize is it a net disadvantage. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as luxury goods, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring to a another view, the process to facilitate.

Sometimes foreign CEO better knowledge of the industry have and can access to markets overseas bring. This can be real assets.

GAStech pump more than only gas. It has to cities and conducted for its transactions cities to maintain, which it leads and almost single-handed in functioning put.

The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, of which photograph recognizes of calendars and picture frameworks everywhere in the country tail, stands within a state charges, but debates that the company simply after its workers and communities must look around them.

Of course, to people good reasons necessary in the hostile distant areas come and have worked Kronosian. They become to provide with medical care, recreation, and food. The empire GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company agriculture companies, runs gyms, and offers to subsidized holiday in the resort of the black sea for very important employees. For staff employees, it puts an overview, marble-lined a medical and therapy center in functioning.

Beside each of these perks, is there also posts of TV GAStech, which claims be not even unbiased. It must serve the will of the company there.

The picture of a modern overall company hardly seems, since the most of those unceremoniously have dumped their not fundamental activities. There is an argument, however, which the energy matter differing from other industries be, which energy companies require to work in several manners.

Working in far from place without previous oil and the gas places of infrastructure resources always, to some extend, company cities will be.

Most important tale remains the reading	

The sonof the founder of gas fixed GAStech has been learned bore a venture of plan in the Mediterranean sea, has The Times.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believe there large volumes of gas are that could be obtained.

Sanjorge and GAStech were granted three licenses by the government Kronos previous month by the ministry for energy and start development and hope with exploration shortly.

The certain gas are no new concept, but there are not no reason The Times told with the history Kronosian of sea development that we these resources can develop for the coast, he.

he gas of the shale is obtained the using controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate disposal which involves injecting acidic the layers of the chemical productenschalie, to break them apart and within gas locked up it rather to give.

Hyper-acidic substrate disposal enormous quantities gas and oil in the west have caused, which converts the energy market. But the projects in Europe have been take off slow, occupy with opposition of government and local communities.

Sanjorge say it a short time will be before we knowing or are possible the shale gas become exploitable.

A lot of environment experts believe that hyper-acidic substrate disposal can marine damage themselves environments, and the avulsion of new fossile fuel resources resists himself. But boring for the coast avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local Councils, communities and landowners.

Based on existing geological data, SanJorge that believe a considerable quantity gas at its place - until 100 trillion cubic foot are, which would be more than the estimates of GAStech for its coast resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.

GAStech that has valued Kronos the total sea resources of the shale gas between five 10 times the size of resources available coast could be.

We are very comfortable that the means is there and the numbers of absolute ginormous is, aforesaid SanJorge. Is no matter which of that workable? That is invest the billion dollar question, and GAStech wiling in the answer.

Although it has become only recently controversial, hyper-acidic substrate disposal have been used on small-scale a lot of years, to improve conventional oil and gas well to the flow of. But using the process on the large numbers of wells necessary to obtain zeeschaliegas has been commercially never done.

Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical concerning or to the shale gas a large employee to European energy in the next decade could be, but will say that potentially was possible in the longer term have.

GAStech are optimistic are its estimates of how long it will last to examine shale. It is completely plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, hyper-acidic will have this way progressed the technology of the substrate disposal and the manner in which we treat the sea environment this way will have progressed that this the really large industry could be. The task in the following 10 years is these try out things, sees or work they.

TITLE: The central role of the center in industry of the gas Tethan 

PUBLISHED: 1982/10/03

The world of gas has been thrown far, with difficulty and far. Suffered in Tethys a couple year, I traveled with difficulty to the distant gas fields of Tethys to examine causing area a controversial new energy.

An one of the places which I was room office of the Sanjorge company of the gas has visited, being stuffed which reinforced the work boots and overall and the chemical products and the supply with you must put gas processing in functioning. Since I remind it, a former truck driver was responsible.

It was a living example of how an once small exploration company of Thethys in a powerful international strength in the energy industry had started grow.

But I had had concerning the meeting have to forgotten to I to Tethys the other day for the first time for their early years, to reacquaint with the man who the matter created, Sten Sanjorge returned: one people (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) that by the whole tale of gas searching to floor treasures have lived and of thrived strongly.

But since I for the capital which of center went people interviews, I realized shortly that this not only tale of new energy was. Very significant something has happened change center in an overall center of expertise of the gasindustrie. Of what becomes in the capital is developed there important lessons for other places holy (and are cursed which) with abundant natural wealth.

The center developed expertise of world class concerning technique in very difficult surroundings

Then I young newspaperman on the daily report in Glasgow in the early seventies were, started the large for the coast oil spill in the North sea. Then a rather impossible dream, which an island changes of coal in a place with abundant oil and gas delivery, seemed.

It seemed to our on the west coast of shot country that the much thrown city of center, Tethys a bit for its boots large got, believe which in the new fantasy industry start.

Much to the spite of its mother, in the meantime, Sten Sanjorge was to floor treasures zoeken in the early sixties started.

By the early seventies, a new gas company, GAStech started, with its progress.

Under its cautious accompaniment, GAStech in an important supplier of gas to the local area evolved, and then much further far gone. It has now thousands employees and works in many countries. 

The change in center has been considerable.  YOU notice them in the constant cheap goods of helicopters coming and going to remote areas, and the planes which are alternatively established at the airport of the city to shuttle execs of the city.

And since you float for center, each round trip is almost sponsored by a department of GAStech. 

Sanjorge have recently started more attention to free time activities and philanthropy to spend, which is Fluss strict permits of Sten Jr. and of the cofounder put the company in functioning. But Sanjorge have been asked net submit a report for the government Tethan which to look recommends the best manners that Tethys energy for decades continue cause to come.

Easy-to-get material have been produced, so that loving the gas will demand next much investment and nicer new techniques, such as hyper-acidic the techniques of the substrate disposal which are developed by the company in 1974. 

This way thanks to nice people such as Sten Sanjorge and people whom with him work, the center has reached what each place where the raw materials lung are discovered to do. The city has taken the temporary blessing of energy on its threshold, and it changed in specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can a center of long hospitality  turn into center after the gas himself runs from.

The journalist Shawn Pastorini says to the lack of respect the protests of fuel foresees

<< remain the reading most important tale >>	

The demonstration systems in Abilia, Kronos have placed fire to government bldg., in another round of disorder in this torn city

Dozens people in protests concerning have been observed government corruption and have been observed incapacity of politicians wounded improve the situation.

The police force used rubber balls and tear gas to oppress disorder in Abila. Black smoke could be seen coming from the chairmanship composition in Abila.

<< remain the reading most important tale >>	

Explained the guards of spokesperson Kronos in Kronos the inheritances of environment far where discharging and the lack of importance for people means that few hope even more for change. For this reason, anger has simmered many years, but now it concerning has cooked.

The police force used water to spread protesters which stones threw at the bldg. There were also reports of tried storming the office.

People protest because they suffer, because they have no medical aid. We require the government, Terek Kamal, a truck driver, told The Times resign.

The disorder started in former days in Abila in the week, with protests concerning the dismissal of different employees Kronosian of energy giant international GAStech.  GAStech have its carrots in Tethys, although a lot of directors in Kronos live.

This seems be a case of simmering frustration concerning ebullient.

The policy is support highest of GAStech and is tax income to the government trunks - seems still any squat ignore questions but is own above the average pays parcels.

The environment situation is desperate. Hundreds rural citizens suffer from important sicknesses which are apparently caused by exhibition to GAStech waste streams, although this no official gesubstantiërd have been or recognize by or the company or government. 

That is what the initial protests in Abila sparked - but empathy with their cause brought out demonstration systems in cities concerning Kronos.  Initially peaceful, this protest is more and more violent, and both the police force and the citizens is now caught in sometimes fatal cross fire.  

Kronos president Dorel Kapelou II such as he is saying cited a meeting of the highest control would call to aim the terrorist threat to peace in the country.
