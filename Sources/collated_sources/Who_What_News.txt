After a long day of conflicting and confusing information reports are still sketchy, but the story is beginning to come clear: a Kronos Government source has confirmed up to fourteen of GAStech International's employees may have been kidnapped at the company's headquarters in Abila. Speculation includes whether or not GAStech International President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motivation behind the kidnapping has also been rampant due to the recent GAStech IPO. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, indicated the Protectors of Kronos were suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events. 

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation, aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.
