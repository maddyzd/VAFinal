Overview
This project explores the complex media ecosystem surrounding the GASTech conflict in Kronos using a combination of Natural Language Processing, embedding-based visualizations, and network analysis. We analyzed news articles to uncover:

Primary vs. derivative sources

Bias and sentiment across news outlets

Social and institutional relationships among key players like GASTech, POK, the Kronos Government, and APA

Key Features
Article Embedding Visualization: PCA projection of embedded articles to detect content similarity across sources and time

Bias Dashboard: Interactive tools to compare sentiment and coverage of individuals and groups across different outlets

Relationship Network Graph: Visualization of connections (official and unofficial) between people and organizations using edge-labeled graphs

LLM-Supported Analysis: We used Gemini to enrich our qualitative interpretations of structured and unstructured data
