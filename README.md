Visual Analytics Tufts University Final Project
Madeline Dumont, Sam Hecht, and Maya Kennedy

**Overview**
This project explores the complex media ecosystem surrounding the GASTech conflict in Kronos using a combination of Natural Language Processing, embedding-based visualizations, and network analysis. We analyzed news articles to uncover:

- Primary vs. derivative sources
- Bias and sentiment across news outlets
- Social and institutional relationships among key players like GASTech, POK, the Kronos Government, and APA

**Key Features**
- Timeline and Wordcloud: Visualizations to obtain a basic understanding of text sources
- Article Embedding Visualization: PCA projection of embedded articles to detect content similarity across sources and time
- Bias Dashboard: Interactive tools to compare sentiment and coverage of individuals and groups across different outlets
- Relationship Network Graph: Visualization of connections (official and unofficial) between people and organizations using edge-labeled graphs
- LLM-Supported Analysis: We used Gemini to enrich our qualitative interpretations of text data
